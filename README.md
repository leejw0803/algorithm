# Algorithm

#### This Repository contains some JavaScript and Python3 algorithm problem solving.
#### The problems came from <a href="https://programmers.co.kr/">Programmers</a> and <a href="https://leetcode.com/">Leetcode</a>.
#### JS is following the camel case, Python is following the snaked case.
#### Write the insight that I get from solving the algorithm problem by organizing it into README.md.
